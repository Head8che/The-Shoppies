# UX Developer Intern &amp; Web Developer Intern Challenge
#### The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs

# The Goal
#### To have a webpage that allows users to serach for OMDB movie titles to be selected for nomination. A total of 5 movies can be nominated be each user.

# The Features
#### Make a simple interface that can do the following: 
- Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
  - Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film
  - Updates to the search terms should update the result list
  - If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
- Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
   - Movies in search results can be added to the nomination list.
- View the list of films already nominated
  - Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list
  -  Movies in search results can be removed to the nomination list.
- Save nomination lists if the user leaves the page

# Technical Aspects   
This application uses Vue, Bootstrap, Axios and OMDB API. 
Movie information were all retrieved from the OMDB API

# Current Limitations
Since this web application is not being hosted on a server I can only redact the API Key from the src. However, it can be still obtained.

# Get Started
#### To get started you can visit https://the-shoppies-challenge-uxui.netlify.app/ to view this project or you can fork this repo and run it locally.
